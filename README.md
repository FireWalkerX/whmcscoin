# whmcscoin

WHMCS gateway for various altcoins.  

This is being developed by Robert Danielson from [https://bigkesh.com](Big Kesh). I'm not good at readmes. Sorry.  

This is a work in progress. If you find any issues or problems, please submit them. 
You'll need to set up the respective daemons on a server somewhere for this to work properly. 
This gateway accepts the coins into your own wallet, so you'll never have to worry about someone else holding them.
